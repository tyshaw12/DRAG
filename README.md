Prepare to Code
Review the game specification and design documents you created in consultation with your team. Make sure your development environment is ready for coding. Be prepared to contact your team mates if you have any questions.

Write the Code
Individually, write the code according to your plan. Don't forget to complete the README file. At a minimum, it should contain the title, description, project structure, required software, your name and email address.

Verify Your Work
Verify that your project runs and works as expected on your computer. Save the project in your remote repository.

Demonstrate Your Mastery
Make sure your program works. When you are sure that it does, return to I-Learn and submit the url for the remote repository.
